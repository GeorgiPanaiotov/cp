# cp
Small cp clone for Linux
There is currently no --help option, but I am expecting a basic understanding of cp anyway.

## Build: 
### You can build this by using gcc or clang, due to the nature of the code - AKA being way too small, there is no need to do a make file
### You can use `gcc -o fileName copy.c` where you replace `fileName` with a name of your choosing for the output file

## Usage: `copy (or however you named your output file) fileToBeCopied fileToCopyTo`
### It's not necessary to create a file to copy into beforehand, the program will take care of it! If you do indeed have a file, please take note that it will replace the contents of it!
